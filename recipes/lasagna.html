        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>It’s all about the layers! 
           I like to keep it simple by using the oven-ready lasagna noodles, which saves you tons of time in the process.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by browning some Italian sausage on the stove top. </li>
            <li>Once you’re just about done cooking that, toss in a couple handfuls of baby spinach and let it cook down.</li>
            <li>Combine the ricotta cheese filling ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Now just layer your ingredients in a casserole dish and you’re all set!</li>

        <h2>Ricotta Cheese or Cottage Cheese?</h2>  
        <p> When adding in that cheesy layer to your lasagna, do you reach for ricotta cheese or cottage cheese? </p>
        <p> My mother in law is a cottage cheese user, and it’s great… BUT – I’m all about the creamy texture of ricotta cheese.</p> 
        <p> I like how it holds up when baked and doesn’t add any extra moisture to the lasagna.</p>

        <p> PRO TIP: If you’re looking for a lasagna that slices nicely without having to serve it with a spoon, </p>
        <p> then you’re going to want to use ricotta cheese.</p>

        <p> For my recipe, I’ve amped the cheese factor by adding in mozzarella cheese as well as parmesan cheese with the ricotta.</p>
        <p> Season it with salt, pepper, Italian herbs and garlic powder, then bind it all together with an egg.</p>

        <h2> How To Layer Lasagna Like a Pro</h2>
        <p> It’s incredibly easy to layer lasagna when you have all your ingredients ready to go. </p>
        <p> Start by spreading 1/2 cup marinara sauce on the bottom of your 9×13″ casserole dish.</p>
        <p> Lay 3 of your oven-ready lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. </p>
        <p> Spread half of your cheesy ricotta mixture over the top of the dry noodles.</p>
        <p> Sprinkle half of the sausage and spinach mixture over the top of the cheese, followed by 1 cup of marinara sauce. </p>
        <p> Lay 3 more lasagna noodles on top, followed by the remaining ricotta mixture and sausage/spinach combo.</p>
        <p> Top with 3 more lasagna noodles and the remainder of the marinara sauce.</p>
        <br>
        <h2> How Long To Bake Lasagna?</h2>
        <p> The trick to making sure you have the best Lasagna is to cover with foil when baking.</p>
        <P> This will create steam inside the dish that’ll help to cook those noodles nice and tender.</P>
        <p> When covered, you’ll bake for 45 minutes. </p>
        <p> Then you’ll remove the foil, top with mozzarella cheese and continue baking an additional 10 to 15 minutes, 
        <p> until the cheese on top is melted, for a total cook time of 60 minutes.</p>
